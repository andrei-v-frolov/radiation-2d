# Radiation 2D
Simulates radiation from moving charge on macOS and iOS, plotting the wavefronts and field lines. Follows algorithm described by [T. Shintake (2002)](https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/l02/papers/TH426.pdf).

Useful for teaching upper division electromagnetism courses, in particular where retarded potentials are used to describe radiation phenomena.
