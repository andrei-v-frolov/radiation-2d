# Radiation 2D

Simulates radiation from moving charge on macOS and iOS, plotting the wavefronts and field lines. Follows algorithm described by T. Shintake ([2002](https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/l02/papers/TH426.pdf), [2003](https://groups.oist.jp/system/files/Radiation2D_NIM2003.pdf)) and the original [Windows implementation](https://groups.oist.jp/qwmu/software).

Useful for teaching upper division electromagnetism courses, in particular where retarded potentials are used to describe radiation phenomena.
